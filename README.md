- [Documentation](https://aneoconsulting.github.io/PymoniK/)

## Why PymoniK? (TODO)

- PymoniK stands on the shoulder of giants, offering all the benefits of having your distributed applications run on an ArmoniK cluster.

> TODO: ArmoniK feature set

- PymoniK is simple to use

## Requirements

PymoniK is a wrapper around the low level APIs of ArmoniK, and thus requires you to have an ArmoniK deployment under the hood. 
    - For more information on deploying ArmoniK please read the [getting started with ArmoniK guide](https://armonik.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/armonik/getting-started.html).
    - For more information on using a PymoniK worker in ArmoniK, please refer to [this guide](TODO)
