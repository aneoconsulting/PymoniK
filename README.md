## Requirements

PymoniK is a wrapper around the low level APIs of ArmoniK, and thus requires you to use an ArmoniK cluster. (PS: It's not that hard)
- For more information on deploying ArmoniK please read the [getting started with ArmoniK guide](https://armonik.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/armonik/getting-started.html).
- For more information on using a PymoniK worker in ArmoniK, please refer to [this guide](TODO)
