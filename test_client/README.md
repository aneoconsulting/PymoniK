# Test Client

This project contains multiple example projects that work with an editable install of the PymoniK version in master. These could both serve as examples and also as a way to test-drive PymoniK during development.  

# TODO: 

- Remove the UV project structure, and instead just use uv scripts with dependencies for each test client.
