## Can I use different Python versions for the client and worker ?

Although you can install different python packages on your execution environment, you're constrained to a single python version on both your worker and client. There is currently no support for switching between different Python versions. If you're using the harmonic_snake worker then you need to use Python 3.10.12 for your client.
